    <h2>Loran Mills</h2>
    <p>Hello, everyone! My name is Loran Mills, and I am 20 years old. I am originally from Wyoming, but I am currently living in Ogden, Utah. I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in applied sciences and computer programming. There are so many careers in the field of technology today, and I love working with computers, so it seemed like the perfect fit for me. In this course I hope to learn how to code and design a website to be able to better prepare myself to enter the world of web design and programming.</p>
    <p>In my free time, I enjoy the electric guitar, video games, and playing outside with my dog. I have a 5-year-old Cream English Retriever who is my best friend! I have been playing the guitar for over 7 years now. I also love to go camping, fishing, and hiking.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church my whole life as I was born in the covenant and was baptized when I was 8. I was baptized in the Sweetwater River in Martin's Cove, WY, in June when the river was still taller than I was and freezing from the snowy runoff. That is still one of my favorite memories of my childhood for many reasons!</p>
    <p>One of my favorite scriptures is 2 Nephi 4:17-35 when Nephi is giving his prayer of strength and faith in the Lord. Particularly verses 28-30 as Nephi declares, “Awake, my soul! Rejoice, O my heart, and cry unto the Lord, and say: O Lord, I will praise thee forever; yea, my soul will rejoice in thee, my God, and the rock of my salvation.” This shows how great Nephi's faith is because he puts all his trust in the Lord even after losing his father, Lehi.</p>
