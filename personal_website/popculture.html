                    <p>Especially over the last few centuries, music has evolved in many ways. From the writings of Bach and Mozart in the 17th and 18th centuries to hard rock and modern pop in the 20th and 21st centuries. 12-stringed nylon guitars became popular in the Mexican culture. Then 6-, 7-, and even 8-stringed guitars became popular in the late 20th century with the rise of rock music and the birth of the electric guitar. From the invention of the first electric guitars in the 40s, the instrument has continued to adapt and evolve with the changing music.</p>
                    <p>Semi-hollow and hollow body electrics were designed specifically for Jazz and Blues music which became popular in the 50s. Rock and Roll became huge in the late 1950s with Chuck Berry’s hit titled “Johnny B. Goode” which featured a leading hollow body guitar backed by a small rhythm section. Later in the 1960s and 70s, hard rock emerged with the psychedelic movements of artists like Jimi Hendrix and The Rolling Stones.</p>

                    <p>One of the most influential bands in guitar history is Van Halen, an American rock group formed in the 1970s and popular throughout the 90s. Lead by guitarist Eddie Van Halen and his signature guitar, they performed a number of hits including Jump, Eruption, Panama, and Ain’t Talkin’ ‘Bout Love. The hard rock is not as popular today as it was then, but many pop artists still use it in their most popular songs. Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran, and Harry Styles have played the guitar in their songs. The guitar has grown in popularity over time and continues to be one of the most popular and influential instruments in the world.</p>
