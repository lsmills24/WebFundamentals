                    <h2>Early Stringed Instruments</h2>
                    <p>The guitar is one of the oldest stringed instruments and has been around in some form for hundreds or even thousands of years. The Lute is an early form of the guitar. However, the guitar we think of today, originated in the early 16th century in Spain. This early guitar only had four strings, as opposed to the most common six-stringed guitars today. Before the addition of the two extra strings, the original four were tuned C-F-A-D; whereas, the six strings were then tuned E-A-D-G-B-E. This tuning sequence is referred to as standard tuning because most guitars are now set to this standard.</p>

                    <h2>Evolution of the Guitar</h2>
                    <p>From the 16th to the 19th century, many changes to the instrument occurred including the orientation of the headstock, the size of the body, the number of strings, and the tuning of these strings. The body became broader, hollower, and thinner to allow the sound to reverberate louder. The frets that are used to pinch the string against and shorten the vibration to allow the playing of ‘notes’ were once sinuous guts from animals wrapped and tied around the neck. These were replaced with ivory and are now metal pressed and glued into the neck of the guitar. The headstock is the top of the guitar where the strings are tied to tuning pegs. On a lute, the headstock is positioned perpendicular to the neck of the instrument, pointing back towards the player. This new, straightened position allowed for easier string management and more stable tuning. Originally, the strings on early stringed instruments were sinews from animals. Later, the rising guitars were strung with nylon and silk strings before eventually being strung with steel.</p>
